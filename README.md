## Description
Learning is an everyday necessity worldwide, which needs to be done the correct way
to be effective. Information tends to fade in what is known as “the forgetting curve”, a problem
that concerns a wide range of population. However, the fading of the data can be reverted and
stabilised by means of various techniques. One that can be used to achieve a good procure of
knowledge is spaced repetition. This method has been demonstrated to provide a sustainable
capacity of memorization for its users. One of the many ways of using it is by means of the
Leitner system, a flashcard approach that determines when is necessary to regain certain
knowledge. Those flashcards are composed by a question and its answer, storing cards of the
same topic in decks. Spaced repetition does not usually consider the motivation of the user.
However, as it is highly important to maintain the user comfortable, gamification has been
introduced to fulfil that purpose. Due to the importance of providing social interaction, a social
network-like approach has been embraced by the application. Due to the importance of fulfilling
the 2030 agenda of the United Nations, considering the SDGs has also been relevant. This work
explains the development of the product, named DeckLearn, as well as its impact towards the
established objectives and working hypotheses.
